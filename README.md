## Overview
The aim of this project is to recreate a simplified Bash shell. This shell should be able to:
- Interpret prompts
- Execute commands (with and without environment)
- Handle `signals` (Ctrl C, Ctrl D, Ctrl \)
- Handle single quote `'`
- Handle double quote `"`
- Manage redirections `<` `>` `<<` `>>`
- Manage pipes `|`
- Handle environment variables `$NAME`
- Handle exit status `$?`
- Have the following builtins:
  - `echo with option -n`
  - `cd with relative or absolute path`
  - `pwd`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`
